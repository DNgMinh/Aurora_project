<h1 id="aurora-scheduler">Aurora scheduler</h1>
<p>This website helps UofM students plan their class schedules easily
and conveniently before registration.</p>
<p>It takes in user input, which are the courses they want to take in a
semester (currently not applicable for Summer terms). Then, using
real-time data scrapped from Aurora, it shows all possible scheduling
options for the userâ€™s registration (no class overlaps). It also
recommends the best option with the fewest class days and minimal time
gaps between classes.</p>
<p>The customization section allows the user to view schedules that
accommodate their specific time preferences.</p>
<p>This website is still under development with more features and
improvements to come.</p>
